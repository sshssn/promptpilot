Looking at the lang.md file, I can see you have a comprehensive set of golden standard prompt structures for Joblogic AI chatbot agents. These are indeed excellent foundational templates that could be leveraged across your entire application. Let me brainstorm some approaches with you:
ðŸŽ¯ Current Situation Analysis
You have 4 core agent types:
Condition Agent - Classifies queries into categories
Other Agent - General assistance with reasoning
Conversation Agent - Handles greetings and escalations
Complex Agent - Advanced troubleshooting with probing
How-To Agent - Step-by-step guidance
ðŸš€ Implementation Strategies
Option 1: Pinecone Vector Database (Recommended)
Pros:
Fast semantic search
Easy to update/version control
Scalable for multiple domains
Built-in similarity matching
Cons:
Additional cost
Requires embedding generation
Option 2: Flowise Integration
Pros:
Visual workflow management
Easy to modify without code
Built-in RAG capabilities
Can combine multiple sources
Cons:
Dependency on external service
Potential latency
Option 3: Hybrid Approach (My Recommendation)
ðŸ›  Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Database Integration
Phase 2: Smart Agent Selection
Phase 3: Dynamic Prompt Enhancement
ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Flow
User creates prompt â†’ "Help me write a customer service response"
System analyzes intent â†’ Detects customer service context
Selects relevant agent â†’ Conversation Agent + Other Agent
Enhances prompt â†’ Combines user input with golden standards
Applies to model â†’ GPT-4, Claude, etc. all follow same standards
Returns consistent output â†’ Professional, structured response
ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
Option A: Pinecone + Custom API
Option B: Flowise Workflow
Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation
Go with the Hybrid Approach:
Store agents in your database with proper indexing
Use Flowise for RAG workflows when you need complex reasoning
Create a smart agent selector that analyzes user intent
Integrate with your playground to enhance any prompt automatically
This gives you:
âœ… Fast access to golden standards
âœ… Flexible RAG capabilities
âœ… Consistent output across all models
âœ… Easy to maintain and update
âœ… Scalable for future agents
Would you like me to start implementing this? I can begin with the database schema and agent selection logic, then integrate it with your playground.
