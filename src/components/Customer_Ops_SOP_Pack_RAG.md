## Steps Taken for Bulk Data Change

1. Clarify what the customer wants (duplicate invoices, amend payment terms, deploy forms, etc.).
2. Ask for job numbers, invoice IDs, account access, or sample files to validate the scope of bulk changes.
3. Note that some actions (e.g., reverting approved invoices, CSV batch updates) may not be directly supported.
4. Suggest submitting Excel files for bulk imports, manual updates, or backend processing.
5. Raise tickets with IDs, escalate to relevant team, and provide status updates.
6. Flag that this may be a chargeable task.
7. Commit to updating customers via email.

**Response Template (Bulk Data Change):**  
- Summarize the requested change and confirm scope with concrete IDs/examples.  
- Explain limits (e.g., cannot revert approved invoices via UI) and propose supported alternatives (Excel import/manual/backend).  
- Provide ticket ID and note that charges may apply.  
- Confirm by email when done and ask the customer to validate.
